## Solution to Puzzle 7

##### Answer -  32509983

##### Algorithm

- The program uses **calculate_next_minute(grid)** to get the next minute grid
- A new grid is created and the program iterates over the input grid and checks for adjacent lifeforms and empty spaces.
- It then use the rules given to update the new grid and stores it in an array
- The main program calls this function until the next grid is present in the array, the program returns the new grid.
- The **calculate_lifeform_score** then calculates the lifeform score for the grid.


get next minute grid function
```
def calculate_next_minute(grid):
    new_grid = [['.'] * 5 for _ in range(5)]
    
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            lifeforms_count = 0
            empty_spaces_count = 0
            
            # Check the four adjacent tiles
            for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:
                x, y = i + dx, j + dy
                
                # Count the adjacent lifeforms and empty spaces
                if 0 <= x < 5 and 0 <= y < 5:
                    if grid[x][y] == 'X':
                        lifeforms_count += 1
                    else:
                        empty_spaces_count += 1
            
            # Apply the rules to update the cell
            if grid[i][j] == 'X':
                if lifeforms_count == 1:
                    new_grid[i][j] = 'X'
                else:
                    new_grid[i][j] = '.'
            else:
                if lifeforms_count == 1 or lifeforms_count == 2:
                    new_grid[i][j] = 'X'
                else:
                    new_grid[i][j] = '.'
    
    return new_grid
```
Calculates the lifeform score
```
def calculate_lifeform_score(layout):
    tile_values = [2**i for i in range(25)]
    score = 0
    
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            if layout[i][j] == 'X':
                tile_number = i * 5 + j
                score += tile_values[tile_number]
    
    return score

```
