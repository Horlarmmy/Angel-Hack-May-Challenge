## Solution to Puzzle 3

##### Answer - Average is 5152


- Using the following function:
```
def permute(string):
    # Convert the string to a list of characters
    char_list = list(string)

    # Generate all the permutations of the characters
    permutation_tuples = permutations(char_list)

    # Convert each permutation tuple to an integer
    permutations_int = [int(''.join(perm_tuple)) for perm_tuple in permutation_tuples]

    print("The possible permutations are {}" .format(permutations_int))
    new_list = []
    for i in permutations_int:
        if (i % 7 == 0):
            new_list.append(i)
    print("The ones that are divisible by 7 {}".format(sorted(new_list)))
    return ((max(new_list) + min(new_list))/2)
```

It seperates the integer string into a list of characters and use the in built permutation method to get the possible permutattions then each result is tested for 7 divisibility. 

We get the list of permutation divisible by 7 and get the average using the largest and smallest number


```
print("The average of the largest and smallest permutation is {}" .format(permute('1867')))
```

The average of the largest and smallest permutation is 5152.0
